## Interfaces (#3)

Now define a property `sound` of the `String` type inside the `Pet` interface
and implement it inside classes to return `dog`, `cat`, and `hamster`
appropriately. In `main()`, as in the previous task, create a `List<Pet>`
containing all three types of `Pet` and iterate through the `List` and print the
value of `sound` for each `Pet`.
