## Base Class Initialization (#3)

Define a class hierarchy with a parent class `Animal` and two children: `Cat`
and `Dog`. Add a property `sound` of type `String` to `Animal`. Add the
corresponding constructor parameters to the subclasses: `Cat` doesn't define
its own `sound` property but only passes a `sound` value to the parent class.

Provide different default values for `sound`: `???` for `Animal`,  `meow` for
`Cat` and `woof` for `Dog`.

Uncomment the code in `main()` to check the default values that are used when
you create instances of specific classes.
