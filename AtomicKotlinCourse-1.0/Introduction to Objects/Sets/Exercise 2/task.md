## Sets (#2)

Write the function `experiment()` to generate random `Int`s from 1 through 25
and place the results in a `Set`. Discover an approximate value for the minimum
number of randomly-generated `Int`s required before the `Set` contains all
values 1 through 25. Return this approximate value as a result of the
`experiment()` function.

`main()` repeats your experiment 1000 times and displays the average result.
